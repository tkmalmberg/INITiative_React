## Technical Challenges

### 1. JSON Objects
...I ran into a lot of trouble with getting used to passing JSON objects between my front and back end. One time I called an instance of an Encounter, and it was an infinitely looping JSON file. The relationship between my encounter and user models was circular, resulting in an endless recursive loop! Initially,I learned how to use serializers in order to better maintain the object's data. But I also found that you can use annotations like @JsonManageReference, @JsonBackReference, and @JsonIgnore to do a similar thing just from the model classes.
